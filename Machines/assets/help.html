<p>
In the center of the screen we have a treasure chest protected by a password and explosives. 
There are four robots around the chest, which must enter the secret code to unlock it properly to attain the treasure, otherwise, the explosive will go off.

<p>
<b>To start playing</b>, click on the treasure chest, which will play a sound sequence. 
You must activate (click on) one of the four robots at a time, in the same order as the sequence played by the chest.
You can replay the sequence by clicking again on the chest.
If successful, you will unlock the treasure without exploding the chest. 

<p>
<b>Score</b>: your score.
<p>
<b>Lives</b>: if it reaches zero, the game is over.
<p>
<b>Left</b>: shows how many steps you still have to get correctly, in order to beat the game.
<p>
Have fun!
